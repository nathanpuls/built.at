# Built.at: A Minimalist Approach to Productivity

In a world filled with complex productivity tools, **built.at** stands out by embracing simplicity. The goal? A seamless, text-first approach to organizing and sharing information, all without the overhead of traditional databases or automation platforms.

## Why Built.at?

### 1. **Hashtag-Driven Organization**
Instead of complex category systems, built.at uses `#hashtags` as labels. These tags are automatically detected, allowing for quick filtering and easy reference across all your notes.

### 2. **Markdown-Like Simplicity**
By using an intuitive syntax—like `;label;text;` for structured data and `/links` for easy navigation—built.at eliminates the need for extra UI elements, keeping everything as lightweight as possible.

### 3. **Cloud-Synced, Public Pages**
Built.at integrates with GitHub for authentication, allowing users to create and edit their own pages while making them publicly searchable. This creates a powerful balance between personal data ownership and accessibility.

### 4. **Instant AI-Generated Web Pages**
Users can describe a webpage concept using voice input, and built.at instantly generates and publishes it under their username. This makes it perfect for quick one-off pages without the hassle of coding.

## The Future of Built.at
With real-time syncing, better integration with GitHub Pages, and a potential expansion into AI-assisted organization, built.at is evolving into a **truly effortless** productivity tool.
